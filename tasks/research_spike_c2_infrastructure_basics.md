# üõ∞Ô∏è Research Spike: C2 Infrastructure Basics (Redirectors + Profiles)

**Goal:**  
Stand up a basic C2 infrastructure stack consisting of a redirector (Apache or Nginx) and a command-and-control framework (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Sliver). Customize and test basic HTTP profiles to simulate real-world beaconing while observing how traffic behaves across layers.

**Why It Matters:**  
Understanding C2 infrastructure is critical to red team operations. Junior operators often rely on pre-built platforms, but building and customizing redirectors teaches OPSEC, detection evasion, and command flow fundamentals.

---

### üîç Scope
- Single redirector (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, home lab)
- Single C2 framework: Mythic (recommended for open source) or Sliver
- HTTP(S)-based beacon channel
- Custom redirector rules & basic profile customization
- Beaconing validation and packet inspection

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Deploy a redirector server (Apache or Nginx)
- [ ] Configure basic redirector rules (e.g., `/blog` = redirect, `/index` = C2 handler)
- [ ] Set up a Mythic or Sliver C2 server with basic teamserver config
- [ ] Create a new HTTP profile:
  - Change default URIs
  - Modify headers (User-Agent, Host, Cookie)
  - Add jitter or randomized sleep
- [ ] Launch test implant and verify:
  - Successful check-in through redirector
  - Proper logging of C2 traffic
- [ ] Use `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, or `Zeek` to analyze traffic and verify OPSEC hygiene
- [ ] Document command structure, redirector logic, and where logs appear
- [ ] Identify what would be obvious to blue team tooling (default headers, jitter, URIs)

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Internal wiki or repo page with:
  - Step-by-step setup of redirector and C2
  - Screenshot of successful beacon check-in
  - Sample HTTP profile used
  - Screenshots or captures of C2 traffic
  - List of OPSEC pitfalls observed (e.g., default URIs or server headers)
- Cleanup instructions or teardown script

### üìà Effort Level
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî setup is straightforward, but testing and troubleshooting adds learning curve.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redirector and C2 deployed and functioning
- [ ] Implant beacon successfully passes through redirector
- [ ] Custom HTTP profile used (non-default URIs/headers)
- [ ] Traffic observed and documented
- [ ] At least 3 OPSEC observations noted (e.g., headers, cert issues, redirect fingerprints)
- [ ] Internal guide or checklist created for future infra deployments
