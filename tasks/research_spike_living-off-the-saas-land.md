# ‚òÅÔ∏è Research Spike: Living-Off-the-SaaS-Land (LOSL) TTP Library

**Goal:**  
Catalog how adversaries (or red teamers) can persist, move laterally, and exfiltrate data inside SaaS platforms using **native functionality** (no malware or implants). Platforms include Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Atlassian, Notion, Zoom, and others.

**Why It Matters:**  
SaaS platforms are now core enterprise infrastructure ‚Äî but often lack strong monitoring and centralized detection. LOSL techniques blend into normal user workflows, making them ideal for business email compromise (BEC), insider threat, or stealthy post-compromise access.

### üîç Scope

**Target SaaS Platforms:**
- M365 (Outlook, Power Automate, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive)
- Google Workspace (Docs, Drive, Gmail, Apps Script)
- Slack, Zoom, Notion, Atlassian, GitHub, Box

**Abuse Categories:**
- Persistence: Auto-forward rules, webhook listeners, shared drive backdoors
- Lateral Movement: Shared calendar/phishing payloads, Slack token reuse
- Exfiltration: Auto-sync to personal cloud, export automations
- Covert Channels: Task comments, docs-as-chat, webhook relays

**LOSL Techniques Include:**
- Outlook inbox rules ‚Üí exfil emails + forward OTPs (T1114.003)
- Power Automate ‚Üí trigger on inbox event ‚Üí write to OneDrive
- Google Apps Script ‚Üí hidden Drive watchers or chat bots
- Slack workflows ‚Üí auto forward DMs to attacker workspace
- GitHub Actions ‚Üí credential leak via CI logs
- Notion integrations ‚Üí data sync to attacker-owned Notion DB

### ‚úÖ Tasks

- [ ] Inventory LOSL-capable features across key platforms
- [ ] Build demo payloads using:
  - Power Automate, Google Apps Script, Slack Workflow Builder, etc.
- [ ] Emulate realistic post-compromise scenarios:
  - Phished mailbox ‚Üí persistence + silent data exfil
  - Insider w/ notion or Atlassian access ‚Üí doc/comment exfil
- [ ] Map techniques to MITRE ATT&CK (enterprise SaaS / cloud)
- [ ] Develop blue team detections:
  - Defender / M365 audit logs, GWS Admin console, Okta, SIEM
- [ ] Document potential blind spots in each SaaS platform

### üéØ Deliverables

- LOSL TTP Matrix:
  - Platform / Technique / MITRE Mapping / Risk / Detection / Status
- Demo Payloads:
  - Scripts, workflows, rule configs, tokenized API calls
- Detection Queries:
  - KQL (Defender), GWS log filter rules, Okta/Splunk examples
- Recommendations:
  - SaaS config hardening (disable risky features, enforce OAuth scopes)
  - User behavior baselines
  - Unified SaaS activity correlation (via CASB/XDR/SIEM)
