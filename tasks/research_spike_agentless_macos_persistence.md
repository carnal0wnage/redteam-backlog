# üçé Research Spike: Agentless macOS Persistence

**Goal:**  
Catalog and test obscure macOS persistence mechanisms that do not rely on agents or noisy payloads ‚Äî such as LaunchAgents quirks, LoginItems database injection, TCC.db tampering, and Apple Shortcuts automation misuse. Identify which ones bypass standard EDR or MDM controls.

**Why It Matters:**  
macOS fleets in the enterprise are growing, yet most red team and detection engineering efforts still prioritize Windows. These lesser-known persistence paths are frequently unmonitored and misunderstood, enabling stealthy access or long-term footholds on dev or exec endpoints.

### üîç Scope
- macOS native persistence vectors:
  - `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` (misconfigured or renamed)
  - `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent`
  - LoginItems database (`~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm`)
  - Apple Shortcuts (trigger automation via network, time, or login)
  - TCC database tampering (`~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`)
- Exclusions:
  - Kernel extensions (requires root; noisy)
  - Known backdoor malware techniques already documented in AV signatures

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Set up clean macOS VM (Ventura or Sonoma recommended)
- [ ] Enumerate and test persistence via:
  - Custom LaunchAgents with nonstandard keys or plist obfuscation
  - Direct LoginItems DB manipulation (SQLite)
  - Shortcuts automation to re-launch apps or connect to C2
  - TCC privilege escalation (e.g., Terminal with Full Disk Access)
- [ ] Observe detection by:
  - macOS built-in logging (Unified Log, Console)
  - Commercial EDRs (if available)
- [ ] Package results into:
  - Red team setup scripts
  - YAML-based detection rules (for macOS log agents or Splunk configs)
  - Validation checklist (manual and scripted)

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Persistence technique catalog (description, path, detection notes)
- Setup PoC scripts (written in Bash, Swift, or Python)
- Example Apple Shortcuts with malicious behavior triggers
- YAML detection rules for:
  - Unusual LaunchAgent behavior
  - BackgroundItems DB anomalies
  - TCC.db modification attempts
- Red team runbook with opsec notes:
  - Noise level
  - Privilege requirements
  - AV/EDR detection history

### üìà Effort Level
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî requires macOS access, scripting, and persistence knowledge.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 3 persistence methods tested on macOS (agentless)
- [ ] Detection coverage for each technique documented (EDR/no EDR)
- [ ] PoC scripts included in repo or wiki
- [ ] Red team notes and blue team detections written
- [ ] Final checklist and YAML rules added to toolkit
