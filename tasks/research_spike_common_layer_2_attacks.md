# üåê Research Spike: Common Layer 2 Attacks (2025 Edition)

**Goal:**  
Test a modern corporate network for viable Layer 2 attack paths, such as ARP spoofing, rogue DHCP, VLAN hopping, and MAC flooding ‚Äî to simulate pivot, sniffing, or DoS scenarios in poorly segmented or legacy environments.

**Why It Matters:**  
Layer 2 attacks still persist in flat networks, legacy infrastructure, or poorly configured access layers. Many EDR and detection platforms focus on Layer 3+ and overlook switch-level or MAC-based abuse, especially in on-prem, lab, or hybrid deployments.

### üîç Scope
- Target environments:
  - Flat Layer 2 subnets (guest VLANs, lab networks)
  - VoIP / printer / unmanaged device VLANs
  - User access switch ports (802.1X or not)
- Still-viable attacks in 2025:
  - ‚úÖ ARP spoofing / poisoning
  - ‚úÖ DHCP starvation + rogue DHCP
  - ‚úÖ MAC address flooding (CAM table exhaustion)
  - ‚úÖ VLAN hopping via double tagging or trunk abuse
  - ‚úÖ STP manipulation (Spanning Tree Protocol root hijack)
  - ‚úÖ Multicast spoofing / IGMP hijacking
  - ‚úÖ LLDP spoofing for topology mapping
  - ‚úÖ Passive packet sniffing in misconfigured environments

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Deploy test system to target VLAN or physical port
- [ ] Run baseline recon:
  - `tcpdump`, `arp-scan`, `lldpctl`, `netdiscover`
- [ ] Execute attacks:
  - ARP spoofing (Bettercap, arpspoof)
  - Rogue DHCP (Yersinia, dhcpstarv)
  - VLAN hopping (double-tagged frames w/ scapy)
  - MAC flooding (macof or custom script)
  - STP root claim via BPDU injection
- [ ] Observe network impact:
  - Sniffed credentials or sessions
  - Pivot opportunities
  - Switch CPU spikes / service impact
- [ ] Identify mitigations in place:
  - DHCP snooping, DAI, Port Security, 802.1X
  - VLAN pruning, trunk restrictions
- [ ] Document effective attack paths vs blocked ones

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Attack result matrix (works / blocked / degraded)
- PCAPs of successful MITM or DoS attacks
- Diagram of switch-level attack surface
- Recommendations:
  - Enforce 802.1X with dynamic VLAN assignment
  - Enable Port Security with MAC binding
  - Deploy DHCP snooping + DAI
  - Disable unused trunking and double-tagged frames
- Scripts for:
  - Automated L2 recon
  - Simulated rogue DHCP injection
  - VLAN tag manipulations with `scapy`
