# üì∂ Research Spike: RFID Relay Attacks via BLE / Wi-Fi (Badge Replay)

**Goal:**  
Build and test a proof-of-concept RFID relay setup that transmits badge data over BLE or Wi-Fi to a remote relay station near a legitimate badge reader. This demonstrates how attackers can access secure areas by forwarding real badge signals ‚Äî without cloning or decrypting them.

**Why It Matters:**  
Many modern RFID systems (even encrypted ones like iCLASS SE or MIFARE DESFire) are vulnerable to relay attacks. This bypasses crypto by transmitting the raw challenge-response in real time. Executives, high-value targets, and keycard holders are especially vulnerable in public areas.

### üîç Scope
- Supported badge types:
  - 13.56 MHz cards (e.g., iCLASS SE, DESFire EV1/EV2, MIFARE Classic)
- Devices:
  - Flipper Zero w/ BLE module
  - Proxmark3 RDV4 or PiKVM w/ USB RFID reader
  - Custom relay setups (ESP32, BLE proxy, Raspberry Pi)
- Environments:
  - Lab or authorized test zone with known card readers

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Choose relay path:
  - BLE: Flipper Zero ‚Üí phone/ESP32 ‚Üí relay reader
  - Wi-Fi: Raspberry Pi sniffer ‚Üí VPN tunnel ‚Üí remote Proxmark
- [ ] Set up reader-side receiver:
  - Proxmark3, contactless USB reader, or commercial door reader in lab
- [ ] Set up badge-side transmitter:
  - Flipper Zero BLE relay firmware or app like `nfc-relay`
  - Phone or ESP32 Bluetooth proxy script
- [ ] Capture challenge/response from real badge
- [ ] Relay signal in real-time to remote reader
  - Confirm if access is granted or handshake succeeds
  - Log delay/latency issues
- [ ] Measure range and signal reliability:
  - What‚Äôs the max distance from cardholder?
  - How much delay is tolerable before handshake fails?
- [ ] Investigate the best tool for the job
