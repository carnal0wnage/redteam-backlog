## 🌩️ Research Spike: Create a Long-Term Stealth C2 Using Legit Cloud Channels

**Goal:**  
Develop a command-and-control (C2) proof-of-concept that uses common cloud services like Google Sheets, Firebase, Dropbox, or Notion as covert channels for bidirectional communication. Focus on stealth, availability, and operator control.

**Why It Matters:**  
Legitimate cloud services are often implicitly trusted and rarely blocked in enterprise environments. Abusing them for C2 allows long-term, stealthy persistence that blends in with normal traffic and bypasses many network-based detections.

---

### 🔍 Scope
- Use cloud services such as:
  - Google Sheets (API for polling commands)
  - Firebase (Realtime DB for beaconing)
  - Notion / Dropbox (push/pull tasks)
- Ensure no special firewall rules are required
- C2 traffic must appear legitimate
- Avoid persistent files on disk (in-memory preferred)

---

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Select and authenticate to a target cloud platform
- [ ] Build minimal implant:
  - Periodically polls for new commands (e.g., via Sheets or Firebase API)
  - Executes tasks and sends back results (obfuscated)
- [ ] Obfuscate command structure to evade inspection (e.g., base64 with padding tricks)
- [ ] Test for:
  - Detection by EDR or DLP
  - Behavioral alerts in CASB/SIEM
- [ ] Add control capabilities:
  - Tasking engine (bash/cmd/injection)
  - Sleep and jitter
  - Kill switch
- [ ] Validate persistence duration, reliability, and stealth

---

### 🎯 Deliverables
- Working PoC C2 with:
  - Configurable polling interval
  - Operator script/dashboard for issuing tasks
- Red + blue team doc:
  - Tactics used (T1071, T1090, T1102)
  - Stealth considerations
  - Detection queries for proxy, CASB, and cloud logs

### 📈 Effort Level
**Large (L)** — requires cloud platform knowledge, secure coding, and detection testing.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fully functional cloud-based C2 channel created
- [ ] Operator tooling supports tasking and output
- [ ] Stealth and persistence validated against blue team visibility
- [ ] Red + blue documentation delivered
