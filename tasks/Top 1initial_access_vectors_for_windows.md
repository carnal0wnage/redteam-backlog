## ü™ü Research Spike: Top 10 Initial Access Vectors for Windows

**Goal:**  
Identify, replicate, and document the top 10 initial access techniques commonly used to compromise Windows systems in enterprise environments. For each vector, simulate or test the method in a lab environment, log what works, and build a repeatable checklist or playbook.

**Why It Matters:**  
Initial access is the first step in nearly every red team operation, ransomware attack, or APT campaign. Mastering these techniques gives junior red teamers critical awareness of how attackers get in ‚Äî and what defenders should monitor or block.

### üîç Scope
- Windows 10/11 or Server systems (lab preferred)
- Non-destructive payloads only (harmless shells, callbacks, or test binaries)
- Delivery methods: email, USB, web, file shares, exposed services

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Research and test the following **Top 10 Initial Access Vectors for Windows**:

  1. **Phishing with Malicious Attachment**  
     - Lure: Word doc with macro or remote template  
     - Tool: `evilginx`, `MacroPack`, `InvisiShell`  
  2. **Malicious Shortcut File (.lnk)**  
     - Delivered via USB drop, phishing, or shared drive  
     - Payload runs PowerShell or connects to external domain  
  3. **USB HID Injection (Rubber Ducky / OMG Cable)**  
     - Device emulates keyboard and executes payload instantly  
  4. **Shared Network Drives (File Drop & Exec)**  
     - Exposed SMB share or misconfigured GPO script  
  5. **Exposed RDP with Weak or Default Credentials**  
     - Brute force or use leaked creds  
  6. **HTA Files (via HTML/Email Drop)**  
     - Embedded VBScript to execute remote code  
  7. **Living off Signed Binaries (LOLBins)**  
     - Use `mshta.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, or `rundll32.exe` for payload execution  
  8. **Remote Code Execution via Vulnerable Service**  
     - Example: EternalBlue (MS17-010), PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527)  
  9. **Infected Installers or Update Binaries**  
     - Fake software or poisoned `.msi`/`.exe` installers  
  10. **Trusted Document Format Abuse (PDF, OneNote)**  
      - Payloads embedded in PDFs, OneNote files, or ISO containers

- [ ] Log results for each vector:
  - Was the payload blocked or triggered?
  - Any endpoint alerts?
  - What telemetry was generated (if monitored)?
- [ ] Note which vectors require interaction (e.g., clicking "Enable Macros") vs. auto-execute
- [ ] Build a summary table with:
  - Access method
  - Execution type (user-driven, auto)
  - Mitigation or detection strategy
- [ ] Build a ‚ÄúTop 10 Initial Access Checklist‚Äù for internal use

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Table of all 10 vectors tested, with:
  - Success/fail status
  - Screenshots or payload results
  - Relevant telemetry or detection output
- Written notes on ease of execution and mitigation tips
- Internal markdown/wiki page with:
  - Top 10 Initial Access Vector cheat sheet
  - Tooling used
  - Lab setup tips
- Optional: Record short videos of each vector for internal training

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 10 vectors tested or simulated in a safe environment
- [ ] Screenshots or output captured for each
- [ ] Mitigation and detection notes written for each vector
- [ ] ‚ÄúTop 10 Initial Access‚Äù table created and shared
- [ ] Tools, scripts, and resources documented for future reuse
