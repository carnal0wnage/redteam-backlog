# üîç Research Spike: GitHub/GitLab Secret Search Tool

**Goal:**  
Create or adapt a script/tool to search GitHub and GitLab (public or internal instances) for exposed secrets such as passwords, API keys, tokens, and cloud credentials ‚Äî scoped to organization projects or user contributions.

**Why It Matters:**  
Secrets frequently leak into source control via `.env` files, hardcoded test keys, or CI/CD configs. Public and internal repos alike represent a high-value attack surface ‚Äî and detection usually lags behind the leak.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

- [ ] Define search targets:
  - Org GitHub repos (public + private via API)
  - GitLab groups or user namespaces
  - Keyword searches: `password`, `token`, `api_key`, `aws_secret`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.
  - Filenames of interest: `.env`, `config.yml`, `settings.py`, `.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`
- [ ] Choose tooling:
  - GitHub API + `gh` CLI or PyGitHub
  - GitLab API + `python-gitlab`
  - Consider Gitleaks, TruffleHog, Gitrob, or custom regex engine
- [ ] Script should:
  - Search recent commits and indexed content
  - Flag high-entropy strings
  - Save context (repo, filename, line number, timestamp)
- [ ] Optional: build exclusion logic for false positives
- [ ] Test against known test repos with intentional leaks

---

### üéØ Deliverables

- Search script (`git-secret-sniper.py` or similar)
- Report output (JSON or CSV): matches with repo URL, file path, context snippet
- Demo screenshots or terminal logs
- Detection regexes or entropy scoring model
- Recommendations:
  - Add secret scanning to all CI/CD pipelines
  - Block secrets via commit hooks
  - Rotate any found credentials immediately

### üìà Effort Level

**Medium (M)** ‚Äî scripting required; can be extended into a persistent scanner or CI/CD hook.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool/script built and functional on at least one platform (GitHub or GitLab)  
- [ ] At least 5+ secrets or simulated hits identified  
- [ ] Regex or detection logic documented  
- [ ] Output includes timestamp, path, and preview  
- [ ] Shared with internal red team repo or integrated into recon workflow
