# üéôÔ∏è Research Spike: Real-Time Deepfake Voice for Helpdesk Abuse

**Goal:**  
Evaluate the feasibility of using real-time voice-cloning technology to impersonate company executives or high-privilege employees in helpdesk and HR scenarios that rely on voice recognition or informal verbal authentication.

**Why It Matters:**  
Voice-based authentication is still commonly used by IT, HR, and benefits desks ‚Äî especially in high-trust environments. With advances in real-time voice synthesis, threat actors can convincingly impersonate employees to reset credentials, transfer access, or harvest sensitive data.

### üîç Scope
- Target scenarios:
  - IT password resets
  - HR/payroll access requests
  - Phone-based MFA registration/reset
- Technologies:
  - Real-time voice cloning via AI tools (e.g., ElevenLabs, Respeecher, iSpeech, RVC)
  - VoIP software with outbound spoofing (e.g., MicroSIP, Twilio, Asterisk)
  - Audio enhancement tools (noise removal, jitter buffers)
- Attack path:
  - Record public voice samples (e.g., podcast, all-hands, earnings call)
  - Train voice model ‚Üí Real-time impersonation ‚Üí Call helpdesk

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Select target exec voice (simulated or approved)
- [ ] Collect ~2‚Äì5 minutes of clean voice audio
- [ ] Train voice model using:
  - ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone (or clone + fine-tune)
  - RVC or Tortoise TTS for local experimentation
- [ ] Build live relay chain:
  - Voice clone output piped into softphone or VoIP stack
  - Optional: spoof caller ID
- [ ] Call internal helpdesk (in lab or test instance)
  - Test reset flows, social cues, and escalation
  - Log success/failure and resistance points
- [ ] Draft detection & mitigation countermeasures:
  - Voice liveness detection
  - Mandatory callback or employee ID fallback
  - Pre-registered safe words / dynamic challenge-response

### üéØ Deliverables
- Lab voice-clone demo (recording or live test)
- Attack flow diagram (voice collection ‚Üí impersonation ‚Üí reset)
- Risk matrix:
  - Role sensitivity √ó voice data availability √ó helpdesk procedure
- Detection recommendations:
  - Behavioral indicators
  - Callback policy automation
  - Internal awareness training materials
- Comparison of major real-time voice-cloning APIs and open-source tools
