# ü™™ Research Spike: Long-Range RFID Badge Capture & Cloning

**Goal:**  
Design or assemble a long-range RFID reader setup capable of capturing badge credentials (e.g., 125kHz HID Prox or 13.56MHz smart cards) from a distance, then clone or emulate those credentials for physical access red team simulations.

**Why It Matters:**  
Many organizations rely on badge-based physical access systems, which are often vulnerable to signal capture, replay, or cloning attacks ‚Äî especially if they use legacy RFID protocols. Understanding this threat helps red teams uncover physical security gaps and train blue teams on real-world badge abuse scenarios.

### üîç Scope
- RFID badge types:
  - 125kHz (HID Prox, EM4100, Indala)
  - 13.56MHz (MIFARE, iCLASS, DESFire ‚Äî for detection only, not breaking crypto)
- Equipment:
  - Proxmark3 (Easy, RDV4, or RDV4.01)
  - Long-range RFID readers (e.g., WAVE ID, long antenna + amplifier)
  - Power supply, antenna design (optional)
- Targets: employee badge environments (lab or controlled test zones)

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Research target badge system:
  - Badge frequency (125kHz vs 13.56MHz)
  - Reader type, manufacturer, credential format (Wiegand, raw HID)
- [ ] Set up reader for **long-range sniffing**:
  - Build or modify antenna for increased range
  - Power reader with portable battery or DC converter
  - Place device near high-traffic badge entry (lab/test zone only)
- [ ] Capture badge data using:
  - `proxmark3` with LF sniff mode (`lf search`, `lf hid read`)
  - Long-range reader connected to USB sniffer or Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Clone badge or simulate emulation:
  - Program blank 125kHz tag (T5577 or HID keyfob clone)
  - Test badge emulator (Flipper Zero, Proxmark tag emulation)
- [ ] Document read range, success rate, reliability
- [ ] Test against common defenses:
  - Shielded badge sleeves
  - Smartcards with crypto authentication (fail gracefully)
  - Multi-tech readers (e.g., fallback to legacy mode?)

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Badge tech matrix:
  - Badge type, frequency, encoding format, reader vendor
- Capture results:
  - Screenshots of raw badge reads
  - Observed UID/Wiegand data
  - Range at which reads succeed (in inches/feet)
- Clone or emulation results (with screenshots or logs)
- Detection & defense writeup:
  - Physical mitigations (badge sleeves, range blockers)
  - Reader configs (disable fallback to legacy mode)
  - Awareness training for badge handling
