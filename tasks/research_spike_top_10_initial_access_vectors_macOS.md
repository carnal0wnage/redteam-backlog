# üçé Research Spike: Top 10 Initial Access Vectors for macOS

**Goal:**  
Research, replicate, and document the most common initial access techniques targeting macOS endpoints. Simulate these techniques in a lab to understand how attackers gain their first foothold ‚Äî and what defenses respond (or fail to).

**Why It Matters:**  
macOS usage in enterprises is growing, but it‚Äôs often less protected than Windows. Red teamers need hands-on experience understanding how attackers exploit trust, user behavior, and built-in macOS features to gain access.

### üîç Scope
- macOS Ventura/Sonoma or later (test VM or physical machine)
- Delivery via email, web, USB, AirDrop, or shared network
- Non-destructive payloads (harmless scripts or callbacks)

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Research and simulate the following **Top 10 Initial Access Vectors for macOS**:

  1. **Malicious Office Macros (Word/Excel)**  
     - Macros still work on macOS Office with prompting  
     - Use test doc with harmless script (e.g., `osascript`)
  
  2. **Malicious `.app` Bundle**  
     - Custom `.app` with disguised payload (e.g., AppleScript)  
     - Delivered via DMG, ZIP, or web download

  3. **Internet-Downloaded Script with Quarantine Bypass**  
     - Use curl/wget to drop file and manually remove quarantine attribute:  
       `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine file.sh`

  4. **Malicious Shortcut or Script via AirDrop / USB**  
     - Delivered as .sh, .command, or even PDF+script payloads  
     - Use Rubber Ducky or OMG cable for auto-exec on insertion

  5. **Default Credential Reuse (e.g., SSH, MDM, Homebrew)**  
     - Attempt access via reused creds, SSH keys, or misconfigured MDM systems

  6. **Abuse of TCC Permissions (Automation/Accessibility)**  
     - Drop or execute payload that tries to access screen, mic, or input  
     - Observe System Preferences prompt and how AV/EDR responds

  7. **LaunchAgent / LaunchDaemon Implantation**  
     - Write a plist file to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` for persistence and auto-execution

  8. **PDF or OneNote Social Engineering (prompt-based)**  
     - Embed script or link in trusted format (safe test only)

  9. **Drive-By Download from Safari/Chrome**  
     - Host fake update `.dmg` or `.pkg` ‚Äî log user interaction, Gatekeeper behavior

  10. **Remote AppleScript Execution (osascript + SSH)**  
      - Use `osascript` or `osascript -e` with a valid user context over SSH  
      - Optional: simulate MDM abuse or Apple Remote Desktop

- [ ] Log whether the attack:
  - Required user interaction
  - Triggered Gatekeeper, AV, or system warnings
  - Resulted in file execution, persistence, or network callout

- [ ] Create a summary table:
  - Vector, delivery method, payload type, detection/mitigation triggered
- [ ] Write internal ‚ÄúTop 10 macOS Initial Access Vectors‚Äù guide
- [ ] Note which attacks work with standard user privileges vs admin

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Internal wiki/markdown page with:
  - Table of each vector, execution success, and screenshots
  - Screenshots of Gatekeeper prompts, AV blocks, user prompts
  - Recommended detection or hardening settings (e.g., restrict LaunchAgents, disable unsigned apps)
  - Optional: shell scripts or `.app` payload templates (benign)

### üìà Effort Level
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî requires lab setup and understanding of macOS-specific quirks (TCC, Gatekeeper, file quarantine).

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 10 vectors researched and at least 5 tested in lab
- [ ] For each vector, log execution result, user interaction needed, and detections (if any)
- [ ] ‚ÄúTop 10 macOS Initial Access‚Äù summary table created
- [ ] Internal writeup or wiki page shared with team
- [ ] Notes on hardening settings and recommended controls provided
