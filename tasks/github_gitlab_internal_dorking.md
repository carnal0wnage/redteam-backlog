# üîç Research Spike: Internal GitHub/GitLab Dorking for First-Party Secrets and Configurations

**Goal:**  
Create an internal list of GitHub/GitLab dorks tailored to your company‚Äôs CI/CD tools, naming conventions, domains, and service identifiers. Use this list to discover exposed internal secrets, webhook URLs, tokens, or misconfigured pipeline files.

**Why It Matters:**  
Search dorks that reflect your company's architecture and culture are far more effective than generic ones. By customizing searches for secrets and sensitive configs, red teams can proactively identify exposures ‚Äî while blue teams can better tune secrets detection pipelines.

### üîç Scope
- GitHub (public + internal GitHub Enterprise)
- GitLab (public + self-hosted instances)
- Relevant repositories tied to:
  - CI/CD workflows
  - Dev environments
  - Infrastructure-as-code (IaC)
  - Secrets-in-code incidents

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Identify internal patterns of interest:
  - Internal domains (e.g., `internal.corp.net`)
  - Common repo names (e.g., `infra-tools`, `jenkins-pipelines`)
  - Known leaked secrets (e.g., `corp_token`, `service_password`)
- [ ] Write and test dorks such as:
  - `filename:.gitlab-ci.yml`
  - `path:.github/workflows`
  - `"secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN"`
  - `"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" AND "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"`
  - `"webhook.site"` OR known red team callback domains
  - `filename:.env` + `"corp_"` prefix matches
- [ ] Run against:
  - Public GitHub (web UI, GitHub CLI)
  - Internal GitHub Enterprise (API or UI)
  - GitLab web and internal GitLab APIs
- [ ] Categorize results:
  - Config exposure (e.g., pipelines, service descriptors)
  - Credential exposure (tokens, keys, passwords)
  - Secrets in test data
- [ ] Optional:
  - Build a CLI or scheduled job to monitor and diff dork hits over time
  - Create Slack alerts or summary dashboards for new results

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- `dorks.md` or CSV with 20‚Äì50 tailored GitHub/GitLab dorks
- Annotated results showing hits, sources, and severity
- Sample regex patterns and match logic
- Optional: cronable scan script or `gh` CLI automation
- Internal wiki or SOP for expanding the dork library

---

### üìö Reference Materials
- [GitHub Code Search](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code)  
- [GitHub CLI `gh search`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_search_code)  
- [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

### üè∑Ô∏è Tags / Labels  
`mid-level` `github` `gitlab` `dorking` `secrets-detection` `code-search` `t1552` `automation`

---

### üìà Effort Level  
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî requires institutional knowledge of internal tooling, CI/CD practices, and naming conventions.

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dork list contains at least 20 first-party tailored queries
- [ ] Run against at least one internal and one external platform
- [ ] Sample leaks or false positives captured and documented
- [ ] Tool or SOP to run dorks on a scheduled basis
- [ ] Wiki page or markdown doc published with results and recommendations
