# üçé Research Spike: Audit Common macOS Developer Tools for Exploitable Features

**Goal:**  
Survey popular macOS developer tools (e.g., Xcode, Homebrew, CocoaPods, Carthage, Fastlane) for misconfigurations, trust issues, or features that can be abused for persistence, code execution, or credential theft.

**Why It Matters:**  
Developer tools often run with high privileges and touch sensitive code, credentials, and services. Abusing these tools can provide stealthy footholds or blend red team activity into legitimate workflows.

---

### üîç Scope
- macOS 12‚Äì14 developer workstations (M1/M2 or Intel)
- Tools such as:
  - Xcode
  - Homebrew
  - CocoaPods
  - Carthage
  - Fastlane
  - asdf version manager
  - Python / Ruby environments (pyenv, rbenv)
- Focus on:
  - Auto-executed scripts/hooks
  - Config files with secrets
  - Extension/plugin loading
  - Path hijacking opportunities
  - First party tools and development scripts

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Inventory tools installed across developer machines
- [ ] Identify tool features or components that:
  - [ ] Run automatically (e.g., post-install hooks)
  - [ ] Source external scripts or unsigned plugins
  - [ ] Leak or store credentials in plaintext
  - [ ] Load PATH libraries from insecure locations
- [ ] Test PoCs for:
  - [ ] Arbitrary code execution via plugin or hook
  - [ ] Escalation via `brew services` or Homebrew formulas
  - [ ] Data exfil from CI integration scripts
- [ ] Check whether Gatekeeper, TCC, or XProtect flag these actions
- [ ] Document any detection or logging artifacts left behind

---

### üéØ Deliverables
- Internal wiki or Markdown report including:
  - List of dev tools and versions
  - Features/flows that enable exploitation
  - Screenshots or logs of executed PoCs
  - Remediation guidance or hardening recommendations
- Optional:
  - Local privilege escalation via dev tools
  - Code signing bypass notes

---

### üìà Effort Level
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî requires macOS familiarity and testing environment setup.

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 3 developer tools analyzed
- [ ] At least 2 abuse paths documented with PoC evidence
- [ ] Report shared internally with remediation recommendations
