# ## üîê Research Spike: Password Spraying Office 365 / Azure

**Goal:**  
Simulate safe, low-and-slow password spraying attacks against Microsoft 365 / Azure AD tenant(s) using tools like `O365Spray`, `MSOLSpray`, or `ROADtools`. Understand lockout thresholds, detection methods, and how attackers identify valid usernames.

**Why It Matters:**  
Password spraying is one of the most common techniques for initial access ‚Äî especially in cloud environments where MFA is inconsistently applied. Junior red teamers must learn how to perform these tests safely and how blue teams detect or miss them.

---

### üîç Scope
- Approved O365 / Azure AD tenant (test, dev, or designated lab tenant)
- Valid user enumeration (seeded test users or existing email addresses)
- Tools must respect tenant lockout policies (max 1‚Äì3 attempts per user per hour)
- **No actual credential theft or brute-force**

---

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- [ ] Research O365 / Azure AD account lockout policies:
  - Microsoft Smart Lockout: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-smart-lockout
  - Determine number of allowed bad auths per user / IP
- [ ] Use one or more of the following tools:
  - [`O365Spray`](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray)
  - [`MSOLSpray`](https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray)
  - [`ROADtools`](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ROADtools)
- [ ] Prepare test data:
  - Wordlist of known or guessable usernames (e.g., `j.smith`, `admin`, `hr`, `marketing`)
  - Wordlist of 1‚Äì2 passwords for simulation (e.g., `Winter2024`, `Welcome123`)
- [ ] Write and execute a spray plan:
  - Limit to 1 password per round across all usernames
  - Wait 30‚Äì60 min between rounds
  - Monitor for account lockouts or MFA prompts
- [ ] Document detection and logging behavior:
  - Was traffic visible in Azure logs, Defender, or SIEM?
  - Were any accounts locked?
  - What telemetry showed up in audit logs?
- [ ] Optional: test with VPN rotation, proxy, or user-agent spoofing

### üéØ Deliverables
- Internal report or wiki page including:
  - Tool used, spray schedule, and username format
  - Screenshots or logs of detection (or absence)
  - Notes on lockout behavior and MFA enforcement
  - Recommendations for improving detection & lockout policies
- Password spraying cheat sheet:
  - Rate limits, safe spray cadence, evasion tips
  - Detection rules (e.g., multiple failures from single IP, horizontal auth)
