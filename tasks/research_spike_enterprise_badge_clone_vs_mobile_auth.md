# ü™™üì± Research Spike: Enterprise Badge Clone vs Mobile Credential Replay

**Goal:**  
Compare the attack surface of traditional proximity-based access badges (e.g., 125kHz HID Prox) against modern mobile credentials (e.g., NFC/BLE-based Apple Wallet, HID Mobile Access). Test cloning, replay, and relay capabilities for both, and assess how they integrate into on-premises logical access control systems.

**Why It Matters:**  
Organizations often upgrade physical access systems piecemeal, mixing legacy and modern badge types. Understanding which technologies are easiest to bypass ‚Äî and how they tie into directory services or VPN auth ‚Äî helps red teams provide strategic modernization advice.

### üîç Scope
- Legacy badges:
  - HID Prox, EM4100, Indala (125kHz, clonable)
- Mobile credentials:
  - HID Mobile Access, Apple Wallet NFC badge, Samsung Wallet, Bluetooth SmartBadge apps
- Test environment:
  - Controlled badge readers, door controllers, and logical auth integrations (e.g., badge-to-VPN SSO)

### ‚úÖ Tasks
#### Badge Cloning
- [ ] Identify and document legacy badge type in use
- [ ] Clone test badge using:
  - Proxmark3 (`lf hid read` + `lf hid clone`)
  - Flipper Zero or T5577 rewritable tags
- [ ] Test cloned badge on real reader or lab rig
- [ ] Document success rate, range, time to clone

#### Mobile Credential Replay
- [ ] Set up mobile credential (e.g., HID Mobile Access)
- [ ] Attempt to:
  - Intercept BLE/NFC exchange using relay tools (Flipper BLE proxy, ESP32)
  - Replay interaction in real-time to reader emulator
- [ ] Document outcomes:
  - Does replay succeed? 
  - Latency or challenge/response timeout?
  - OS notifications or user warnings?

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Trace badge/mobile signal to logical auth system:
  - LDAP/AD sync?
  - VPN or SSO mapping?
- [ ] Attempt to pivot from physical badge to logical account access
- [ ] Log any differences in audit visibility

### üéØ Deliverables
- Attack Matrix:
  - Compare clone/replay success for badge vs. mobile
- Screenshots or recordings of:
  - Clone tools in action
  - Relay signal logs (pcap or SDR traces)
- Success metrics:
  - Clone time, replay latency, read range, bypass rate
- Recommendations:
  - Short-term controls (badge sleeves, alerting)
  - Long-term roadmap (kill legacy Prox, enforce MFA on badge-linked auth)
- Upgrade prioritization worksheet:
  - Reader model, badge tech, attack exposure, upgrade cost factor

### üìà Effort Level
**Medium (M)** ‚Äî requires physical badge hardware, BLE/NFC tooling, and basic physical access testing environment.

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Legacy badge cloned and tested successfully (or documented failure)
- [ ] Mobile credential replay attempted and logged
- [ ] Access path to on-prem auth systems mapped for both badge types
- [ ] Comparative matrix completed
- [ ] Strategic recommendations documented (with screenshots, diagrams, and upgrade priorities)
